        <h3>About.</h3>
        <p>
          It all started with a Python-coding competition in an AP Physics class, where Sadie first
          discovered her love for coding. This spark led her to the University of Florida, where she
          dove headfirst into a Computer Science degree. But Sadie's journey didn't stop there.
          She's worked alongside an eclectic mix of professionalsâ€”machinists, knife makers, and even
          a startup obsessed with harnessing the glow of fireflies.
          <br />
          Her curiosity pulled her into the Digital Worlds Institute, where she explored the early
          realms of the virtual reality metaverse. Now, armed with a Master's degree, she's crafting
          awe-inspiring worlds and experiences with Chromatic Games. Her adoration for game
          development has flourished in the titles <i>Dungeon Defenders: Going Rogue</i>,
          <i>Dungeon Defenders: Awakened</i>, and numerous internal projects.
